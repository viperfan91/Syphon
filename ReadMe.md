YouTube Downloader
======
Download the highest quality possible from the video URL provided

Why:
====

All of the YouTube downloaders I've used in the past have all had something missing. This is my chance to do exactly what I want how I want.

Things to do:
=============
1. Check for and, if not found, create local/bin folders inside /usr
2. Check for and install fmmpeg
3. Speed up the quality check process.

Things Completed:
=================
• Choose wether to grab Audio, Video, or Both.
• Check for proper input before starting script.
• Add a check for youtube-dl and prompt to install if needed.
