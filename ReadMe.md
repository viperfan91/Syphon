Download the highest quality possible from the YouTube URL provided

Why:
====

All of the YouTube downloaders I've used in the past have all had something missing. This is my chance to do exactly what I want how I want.

Things to do:
=============
1. Grab video Title and display upon loading to make the process a little more professional. 
2. Add the ability to use only the video ID instead of needing full url


Things Completed:
=================
• Choose wether to grab Audio, Video, or Both.

• Check for proper input before starting script.

• Add a check for youtube-dl and prompt to install if needed.

• Check for and install FFmpeg

• Check for and, if not found, create local/bin folders inside /usr

• Speed up the quality check process.

• Handle video title change with various punctuations

• Added progress bar for downloads
